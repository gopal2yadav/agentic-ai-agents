# Agentic AI Agents  

This project aims to build agentic AI agents inspired by Moltbook. The goal is to create a framework where multiple specialized AI agents can collaborate to perform complex tasks, share context, and provide interactive user experiences.  

## Features  
- Modular agent architecture: define different agent roles (e.g., data retrieval, reasoning, summarization).  
- Shared memory and context management between agents.  
- Task orchestration engine to coordinate agents for user queries.  
- Web-based interface for interacting with agents (future work).  

## Getting Started  
This repository is currently a scaffold. Future commits will include Python code implementing the agent framework. Feel free to contribute!
