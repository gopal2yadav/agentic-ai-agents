# Web Frontend

This directory will contain the Next.js-based web interface for the Agentic AI Agents platform.

The web UI will serve as an agent studio for creating, configuring, and running agents and workflows. It will allow users to interact with agents, visualize their memory and context, and manage runs. More details and implementation will be added in future commits.
